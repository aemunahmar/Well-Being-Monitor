# Well-Being-Monitor

The main goal of the project is to develop a website application that will solve a defined
problem in the medical field. The intended outcome is to allow patients, doctors, and
pharmacists to have easier access to health records and be able to view any updates on the
patientsâ€™ files.
This website application keeps track of health records while providing cross-examination to
ensure the accuracy of the updated patient records. A back-end system was set up to allow
patients to register accounts and allow doctors, pharmacists to sign into their accounts.
Depending on the user identification , they have different dashboards that contain buttons
to manage/prescribe medication, add/edit new patients, manage/view patient records and
view health reports. The unique system functionality includes a feature that generates a
drug allergy alert when a Doctor prescribes a medication and the ability for the Pharmacist
to approve and decline a prescription.
